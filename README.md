# Hey there, Ciao fellow tech enthusiasts! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm thrilled to have you here exploring my world of code and innovation. 🚀

## About Me

I'm a junior control engineer and a passionate startup founder with over 2 years of immersive experience in the captivating realms of reinforcement learning, machine learning, and robotics. I live and breathe technology, constantly pushing boundaries to create smarter and more efficient solutions.

Currently, I'm proudly wearing multiple hats – I'm actively engaged in my role as a junior control engineer, fueling my hunger for knowledge as a master's student at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, and of course, I'm enthusiastically driving my startup venture forward. 🌟

## What Sets Me Apart

My journey has led me to master a plethora of cutting-edge frameworks that serve as the foundation for my groundbreaking projects. I'm a maestro in harnessing the power of TensorFlow and PyTorch to conjure magical machine learning models, while my nimble fingers craft beautiful experiences using Flutter. With a myriad of successful projects under my belt, I've honed my skills to create both practical and visionary solutions.

## Collaboration and Robotics Enthusiast

I'm not just a lone coder in a sea of possibilities – I thrive on collaboration! I'm always excited to connect with fellow robotics aficionados, tech geeks, and visionary minds. If you're as passionate about pushing the boundaries of robotics as I am, let's team up and create something extraordinary! 🤝

## Current Focus: Active Fault Tolerance in Quadrotors

My current project has me deeply engrossed in the exciting world of active fault tolerance in quadrotors facing motor failures. Imagine the thrill of programming these agile machines to respond intelligently in the face of adversity. I'm working tirelessly to make this vision a reality, and I can't wait to share my progress with you!

## Let's Connect!

I'm more than just code – I'm a burst of energy and enthusiasm wrapped in bytes. Let's embark on this exhilarating journey together. Explore my repositories, get in touch, and let's create a future where technology knows no bounds.
